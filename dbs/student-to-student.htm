<OL>
  <LI>Knowing my particular learning style, I was a bit apprehensive when the 
  only workable section of Business Statistics for my schedule was offered 
  on-line.  I usually perform best in a traditional class environment.  The 
  combination of an on-line class and the challenging nature of the material to 
  be covered contributed to my nervousness.  I found however, that it was not as 
  bad as I had imagined.  Do not get me wrong, there is a lot of work involved, 
  but with the detailed lecture notes, assigned readings, homework problems, 
  E-labs and computational tools, and most importantly Dr. Arsham’s 
  encouragement you can succeed in this course. 
  <P>It was exciting to be able to apply certain concepts learned in the course 
  to an actual work assignment I was doing at the time.  The ability to apply 
  one concept in the "real world" encouraged me to look for ways to incorporate 
  the other concepts learned. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thank you very much Professor Arsham.  I can truly say that out of all the 
  statistics class that I have taken I learned the most in this one.  In the 
  past it was a matter of just going through the motions, but the way this 
  course was run and the way the supplementary materials were provided above and 
  beyond just reading the book, made things clearer and easier for me to 
  understand.  I fee like I "know" statistics.  Thank you again. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I felt this was a valuable course and allowed me to get a good grasp of 
  how statistics can be applied in business. The course was well taught and 
  organized and Dr. Arsham was always very responsive, which I find helpful in 
  and online class. The lectures notes are extremely are detailed and help you 
  to comprehend the material. The websites and Elabs also provided additional 
  information that helped me to comprehend the material. Even for those with 
  statistical background, this is an excellent course that teaches you the 
  application of statistics in business. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham was one of the most professional and understanding instructors 
  I have had at the University of Baltimore. He was very responsive to student's 
  questions and was very fair in the grading process. Although his class was 
  difficult, I believe that he helped students grasp very complex statistical 
  subjects. The work assigned was time-consuming and demanding, but did prepare 
  the student thoroughly for the mid-term and final exams.   <BR>Although I had 
  the option of taking this class at a community college, I took it from Dr. 
  Arsham because I was told that he was one of the best at communicating the 
  concepts. I was not disappointed. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I truly enjoyed this class and really liked the student-professor
   interaction. <BR>I get nervous when I take online classes because you just 
  never know. I appreciated your fast responses to all the questions that I 
  asked. It was a pleasure to be in your statistics class this semester. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>During the first week of this class, I was overwhelmed by how much work we 
  were required to do. You need to finish the homework in the textbook, which is 
  probably the only required homework for most of other classes, redefine the 
  keywords learned in the week, review some Web sites, and experiment a few 
  E-lab tools. Needless to say, the first week of the class was hectic for me. 
  However, once I settled in the pace of this class, I understood the importance 
  of all these exercises. Although I don't like a professor to keep me too busy, 
  I have to say that I cannot find any better way to teach this class than the 
  way Dr. Arsham is teaching. All those exercises link to each other and help 
  you understand the course contents deeply. You can see how much efforts and 
  thoughts that Dr. Arsham has put into this class. This is one of the most 
  enriched online classes that I have ever taken.  
  <P>If you will take this class, my advice to you is plan ahead, organize your 
  time, and stick to your schedule. You will learn more than you can hope for. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I really enjoyed this class. I thought the amount of materials were just 
  right. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in business 
  decision-making. It provides you with tools that enable you to be objective, 
  thoughtful, and a careful in your daily business activities. It requires you 
  to think through the numbers, see beyond the obvious. You might have seen so 
  many business leaders making decision on the fly. They seem so intuitive. Are 
  they really? I thought that each and every businessperson must be required to 
  take this course. It is this simple; the decision made by a businessperson 
  affects not only her but others surrounding her. It is not an important 
  course; it is a critical course. 
  <P><B>How I studied:</B> The web-based class that I took from Dr. Arsham was 
  full of information. He was available for your questions via Forums and email. 
  His Web site and ELABS are just mind-boggling. The amount of information come 
  from Dr. Arsham's Web site is an outstanding resource that you can always fall 
  back on. 
  <P> If you just did exactly what specified in the weekly outline, you would be 
  fine. However, this is how I worked on this class. This is strictly my 
  personal choice. I started each week by reading the outline, skimming through 
  the lecture notes and extra reading, reading the textbook assignment. I did 
  these steps in a normal pace. I normally would miss many important points. I 
  just did not want to get bogged down while reading the first time. I just want 
  to get the big picture first. This worked well for me. I then started on my 
  homework, hidden homework in lecture notes. Homework assignment often includes 
  even numbers that does not have answers. I usually did extras including the 
  odd numbers with answers in the back of the text in addition to the actual 
  assignment. This way I would know if did it right. It took extra efforts but I 
  would understand the subject in finer detail. When I'm done with the homework, 
  I would write definitions of new terms I learned this work in my own words. If 
  you could explain it yourself, you would more likely understand the subject. I 
  then review the Web sites, and started using the ELABS. Often time, the ELAB 
  helped to ensure that my homework problems were correct. Finally, I went back 
  and read the outline, the lecture note, the recommended extra readings, and 
  the text. This time, I usually captured all the important points. So, as you 
  can see, there is a lot of work.  
  <P>The way I see it is when I make a business decision in the face of 
  uncertainty, I want to minimize my risk and maximize my result. The more I 
  learn today, the less risky moves I will make in the future. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I would like to say how much I learned in this course.  It is the 5th 
  course I have taken at UB and so far is the most valuable.  I have taken two 
  previous probability and statistics courses before but this is the first one 
  with such a valuable emphasis on practical application.  I have always 
  maintained that college gives you a good background, but you need business 
  experience to learn the practical side.  The same cannot be said for this 
  class.  You should be proud of your work and teaching.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>This Business Statistics class was informative and actually did quite well 
  in providing a general background in statistical methods. It had a perfect mix 
  of information for required learning, combined with plenty of deeper incite 
  and examples so that a very interested student could spend as much time and 
  learn as much more as he felt inclined.  All in all a good experience and a 
  must for any business oriented professional. The information learned allows us 
  to understand what a professional statistician might do, should we want to 
  hire one, and to be able to ask the right questions to verify the usefulness 
  of his/her results. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I was worried whether I should take an online course or not, especially 
  Statistics, because I really didn't know if it was going to be as informative 
  and as effective as a classical course, but at the end of the course I found 
  out that it was much better. In my opinion, flexible hours are the key to the 
  success of a web course. I encourage everyone to take a web course at least 
  once in his or her academic study periods. 
  <P>I really learned a lot from Prof. Arsham. He is one of the best in his 
  field. He really helps a lot if you have a problem with an assignment or in 
  trouble trying to finish it on time. The assignments first may seem a little 
  bit long, but as time passes you get used to the subject and finish them 
  quicker. Also if you are stuck with some of the questions, there is always 
  someone from the class to ask in the Discussions section. I really enjoyed 
  this course and I recommend it to everyone. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I was to start off by saying that the online course content was perfect - 
  well prepared and easy to follow. The computational tools that are available 
  online is an effective learning tool that helped me understand the concepts 
  better.  <BR>Dr. Arsham is a very effective teacher. Without his interest and 
  enthusiasm I would not have increased my knowledge of the subject to the level 
  I am at now. His choice of homework problems was simple, but good enough to 
  understand the concepts from an MBA standpoint.  <BR>Dr. Arsham created a 
  stimulating atmosphere, explained assignments clearly, reviewed assignments in 
  a timely manner and encouraged us to share our work with other students, 
  thereby creating an environment to learn form each other’s mistakes.  <BR>Most 
  importantly, Dr. Arsham graded and returned assignments in a timely manner. 
  This helped me a lot because I was able to see my progress on a weekly basis. 
  The textbook was also easy to follow, and applying the concepts to solve some 
  of the business problems made the course much more interesting.  <BR>I do not 
  personally know other Statistics Professors at the University of Baltimore, 
  but I don't think one can expect anything more than what Dr. Arsham has to 
  offer. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I must say that the past several weeks have been extremely valuable to me. 
  I have learned many new techniques and the real world applications of these 
  statistical tools. I hold this course as one of the most informative of all 
  the MBA training. You must be commended for the excellent preparation and 
  thorough explanations of the concepts. The course was most enjoyable. It was a 
  pleasure to have you as an instructor again. Thank you for everything. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I have taken a mathematical statistics course before so I did not expect 
  to learn a lot from this course.  Was I wrong?  Granted, most of the 
  theoretical aspects covered in the course were not new to me, although a 
  couple of concepts not covered adequately in my prior course were cleared up 
  in this one.  <BR>What I learnt was the practical aspects of statistics - how 
  to apply the theory in practical, real-life situations, when to do what and 
  when not to do what.  This is exactly what the course is supposed to be and 
  why the course would be extremely useful for anybody engaged in business, or 
  even in every day life. <BR>The assignments were not difficult but accurately 
  tested the student's understanding of the course materials.  One must learn 
  and understand the materials in order to successfully complete the assignments 
  so honest effort must be put in consistently during every week.  <BR>Dr. 
  Arsham was responsive to the forum postings and provided prompt response to my 
  emails, assignments, and the "few minutes papers".  The web site reviews and 
  the e-labs exercises provided additional learning venues and insight to the 
  materials. The lecture notes from the <A href="http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/opre504.htm" 
  target="new">Statistical Thinking for Decision-Making</A> has lots of 
  additional materials, especially on the theoretical side.  It can be difficult 
  reading but adds to the course for those theoretically inclined like me.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>Professor Arsham is a great instructor. He was very responsive to any 
  question I had and always made sure that everything was clear. He is a "true" 
  teacher as he was at the same time encouraging, positive, and visibly cared 
  about my progress. In addition, he was also eager to learn from the students 
  and always welcomed feedback. I dared to several suggestions and I was amazed 
  at how quick professor Arsham was to respond and sometimes apply them. I truly 
  enjoyed taking this class. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>This class definitely provides you with a tool set to help make 
  better-informed decisions under uncertainty using statistical thinking 
  process.  The class notes that Dr. Arsham provides are superior to any other 
  class notes I have ever seen.  These lecture notes will be your best friends 
  when it comes time for exams and homework.  This is a class in which you must 
  keep up to date on the course material or you will fall behind.  The material 
  presented is a very reasonable amount, yet it will challenge you.  If you have 
  any questions, do not hesitate to contact Dr. Arsham.  He will reply very 
  quickly and help you the best he can. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The first thing I would recommend to anybody taking this class is to keep 
  up with the homework. You can easily submit each week's assignments in parts. 
  Dr. Arsham is very prompt when answering emails which helps if anybody has a 
  question while completing an assignment. In addition, Dr. Arsham has the rare 
  quality of being encouraging and caring about his students' learning. I never 
  felt intimidated about asking a question or afraid that admitting that I did 
  not understand something would affect my grade negatively. As a result I 
  probably worked twice as hard for this class. Although the book is very good, 
  Dr. Arsham's lecture notes are a must. They are very clear and full of useful 
  examples.  The syllabus and assignments are very well set up for the web 
  format. I want to thank Dr. Arsham for a great class, he made it very 
  enjoyable and I learned a lot.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>I cannot say enough well about the instructor. He was supportive, 
  responsive, caring, and nurturing. I feared this course, yet he consistently 
  encouraged me to overcome my fear. He was instantly responsive to my every 
  question and concern. The text and reading materials provided good support for 
  the required work. He was fabulous! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>As I reflect on my experience a few important points come to mind.  The 
  first is the importance of Dr. Arsham's lecture notes in this class.  I often 
  found myself not understanding the material after my first read of the 
  textbook.  The lecture notes often provided me with clarification.  For those 
  students, like myself, with limited previous exposure to advanced mathematics 
  will benefit from the tutorial offered in the first week of the course.  I 
  also gained a greater understanding of the material when I reviewed the 
  solution examples that the professor posted after handing in the weekly 
  assignments.  The last and most important thought that comes to mind is that 
  Professor Arsham is very helpful and always returns his Emails promptly with 
  information attached.  He was a partner in my relative success in his course.  
  I would suggest that future students in this course not hesitate in utilizing 
  Professor Arsham as a valuable resource.  A very good man. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thanks for a great learning semester. For future students I suggest that 
  they work hard and start  each week immediately. The course material is not to 
  simply read and remember variety. Rather it is something you must read, 
  experience and test yourself on. Personally I found it helpful to begin trying 
  to practice the techniques in my actual work environment - by applying to 
  subject matter you understand the concepts and applications become clear. The 
  textbook is OK but the real core of the course is the professor, lecture notes 
  and exercises. The goal is not the answer to the questions but the method. 
  <BR>I appreciated all your help this term and hope to have another of your 
  courses before I graduate. I certainly have much more to learn in this field 
  and look forward to doing so. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Thank you very much for your efforts throughout this semester. Your quick 
  responses to mine and the rest of the students’ concerns were very reassuring 
  for me during this course. I travel a lot for work, and this was a very 
  valuable option for me. It was comforting to know that the teacher would 
  maintain a very good line of communication with the students despite the 
  distance from the actual physical campus. Thank you. <BR>Our course, the 
  course material is being used by other universities all over the world, 
  professionally, as an aspiring Scientist, this is a reassurance that the 
  University of Baltimore MBA program is of international caliber and offers the 
  student a broad range of classes and programs including a top notch program. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham was very responsive to my e-mails. He responded quickly and 
  consistently offered his assistance. I appreciated guidance and assistance 
  with several of the areas I was having difficulty with. I have increased my 
  knowledge greatly, which is in part due to Dr. Arsham's teaching style. It was 
  evident that he was committed to ensuring students increased their knowledge 
  base in the area of decision-making. I feel that I have been fortunate to have 
  him as a professor/mentor. Some assignments were intense for me at times but I 
  knew that Dr. Arsham was available to provide the direction I needed. I hope 
  there will be other classes he teaches that I will be able to take. Thank you, 
  Dr. Arsham! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I feel that I have a very good understanding of your course and plan to 
  use what I have learned for years to come. It was truly one of my favorites. 
  As far as exams feedback goes, I thought the exams were very fair and there 
  were no surprises. It was very generous of you to allow us to choose our 
  questions to equal 100 points. All of the questions were either based on 
  material covered in the lecture notes and homework  assignments or in the 
  reading from the text. And, as you said, the exams were a mix of theory and 
  applications. Thanks for the great course.  
  <P></P>
  <LI> I have enjoyed the class. Your prompt response and willingness to work 
  with us has made this a very beneficial experience. I was not sure how this 
  would work being that seeing someone does the problems usually helps in the 
  understanding. The book was easy to follow and very understandable. Your 
  prompt and helpful assistance made this a good experience. 
  <P>Thanks again. I hope more classes are offered this way. I feel I got more 
  attention and learned more. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I have enjoyed this class very much. You have done a fantastic job at 
  coordinating this web class. I have learned a great deal in this class. "Thank 
  you" is not sufficient to express your contribution to my ongoing business 
  education. 
  <P>I was very impressed at the number of sites, which have Dr. Arsham's 
  lecture notes as the top site. It is the web site with the best information on 
  the topic.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>The Business Statistics that we have learned in this course is essential 
  for organizational and societal decision-making. This is a great course. I 
  thoroughly enjoyed also reviewing the web sites ever week. It is nice to know 
  that this course is identical to its Ivy League counterparts. Thank you for 
  including the statistics  analysis and its comprehensive coverage, this 
  certainly is useful to many areas of MBA program.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>Business  Statistics is really the science of decision-making under 
  uncertainty.  I enjoyed this class because I not only learned how to make 
  mathematical models to use for decision making in a job related environment.  
  I also learn how to make good decisions in every day life.  Professor Arsham 
  gave his students every opportunity to success in his class.  He was willing 
  to answer questions, even on the day of the exam before it started.  My job 
  requires me to work out of town at times and Professor Arsham was more than 
  willing to accommodate due dates for homework to work with my schedule.  
  Because of this I was able to excel in his class and hope that in the future I 
  have professors that are just as knowledge about the subject they teach and 
  are as willing to help me succeed.  I believe Professor Arsham made a good 
  decision to become a professor and share his knowledge and enjoyment for 
  Business  Statistics.  
  <P></P>
  <LI> Business  Statistics, by definition, is the scientific approach to 
  decision making under uncertainty. However, in this course, you will not only 
  learn about decision-making  (and its scientific approaches), but by the 
  semester's end, you will be able to think as a scientist! The course itself is 
  structured so that you are able to develop proficient skills at 
  decision-making, and then test your skills through use of computer-assisted 
  learning. The textbook guides you through the process, and will introduce you 
  to computer package. You will also be exposed to a variety of outside sources, 
  available at your fingertips, through the wonders of the Internet and the 
  World Wide Web. Lastly, you will have Dr. Arsham' lecture notes, that will 
  guide you through this learning process with his wisdom and knowledge. And, to 
  answer the question you are dying to ask: the mid-term and final are extremely 
  fair in nature. Personally, I enjoyed this class, and I learned in this 
  course.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>I really enjoyed this course. I feel that I have learned real world 
  applications of Business  Statistics. I enjoyed reviewing different Web sites 
  on the topic, because it gave me a chance to learn different applications of 
  Business  Statistics. Dr. Arsham was an excellent professor. He provided very 
  good lecture notes and always gave very helpful feedback. His responses were 
  always very prompt and informative. I highly recommend taking this course with 
  Dr. Arsham. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I would also like to say that this course has been a great experience. It 
  seems strange to not have met you, however, perhaps we will meet someday soon. 
  You have truly been an encouragement and inspiration. It has been great to 
  have such quick response to questions and postings.  
  <P>I felt that the exams were good representations of what we have learned. 
  They were very fair as well. I thought they had a nice mix and formulating 
  problems as well as application. I personally used the two hours limit right 
  to the minute, however, so I felt a bit stressed during the exams. I like the 
  way members of the class contribute sample questions. It helped a lot in 
  studying for the exams. Thanks for a great class!! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I would like to add my "thanks" to those of the other students. I am 
  pleased to report a very positive learning experience for my first (and not to 
  be the last) Web course. You are to be commended for the time and effort you 
  put forth to develop the on-line course and to maintain contact with the 
  students. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I believe the learning experience is based on what the student puts into 
  the class. No matter where or how you take it, if you give it all your effort 
  and utilize the resources available, you will do well.  <BR>One thing that is 
  weird for me about this class is that I feel like I have developed a better 
  relationship with Prof. Arsham than any other professor so far in the MBA 
  program. Even though I have not seen him or talked to him in person, I feel 
  like I get more individualized attention based on the email responses. Thank 
  you for a very educational semester. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I certainly agree that we are getting more individualized attention. I do 
  feel freer to ask questions. As compared to the other web class that I am 
  taking I feel that this class has offered me so much more as in the way of 
  flexibility, attention from the professor, quicker responses on e-mails and a 
  better understanding of the course material. As a full-time federal employee, 
  I value the ability to "attend" Prof. Arsham's class when it best suits me, 
  within the weekly constraints of his program of course.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>I agree on the value of distance-and Web-based learning. Especially the 
  notion that I have gotten to know Prof. Arsham almost better than if we had an 
  in-person class. There is certainly the objective aspect of one-on-one emails, 
  which requires both parties to be proactive.  <BR>Thanks for a great learning 
  experience. I enjoyed the class thoroughly and look forward to applying my new 
  skills. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I really enjoyed this class in the Web based format. I had a very busy 
  spring as I took two classes, started a business, and had a baby, all during 
  the last 4 months. The flexibility of the course made it possible for me to 
  get the work done. Thanks for your quick responses all semester long. <BR>
  Professor Dr. Arsham was wonderful. I have had him for other class and he is 
  excellent on the web class too. A definite recommendation for him in this 
  class! Assignment is worthwhile &amp; valuable. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I believe that web students are able to receive more individual attention 
  from the professor than they would in the classroom setting. This, in turn, 
  allows me to understand the material as I receive personalized comments and 
  specific feedback from the professor. I have enjoyed your class and I have 
  learned a lot.<BR>Arsham was always available for consultation &amp; made the 
  "Web-based" class more enjoyable. He was very helpful and willing to put forth 
  the time to make the web program work, his close rapport with students was 
  positive and goal oriented. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Prof. Arsham was engaging and thought provoking, and responsive to his 
  Web-based Students. I would readily take another course with him. Readings Web 
  site material was appropriates, relevant and useful. Other assignments were 
  concentrated on relevant topics. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I found the course to be one of the most interesting and valuable in my 
  MBA training. The useful tools and guidelines for decision making offer 
  managers the resources that are needed to assist with important strategies and 
  planning for a firm. The tangible analysis that assigns measurable values to 
  decision alternatives is critically important to assess the correct course of 
  action. One can easily find real world applications for this vital teaching.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>This was the second course I have had with Dr. Arsham. I must admit that I 
  was delighted with his teaching methods, inspiration, dedication, and 
  enthusiasm. The use of the www, software package, text problems, and readings 
  was quite appropriate and thought provoking. Dr. Arsham's dedication to the 
  educational process is clearly seen throughout this program. His willingness 
  to work with his students is beyond compare. It is no small wonder he is a 
  "Distinguished Research Professor of Statistics and Decision Science." I 
  highly recommend Dr. Arsham and wish all those that follow, best wishes. 
  <P></P>
  <LI> Business  Statistics and Dr. Arsham, one could not have asked for a 
  better combination. As a student, I really appreciate when I take good classes 
  that have good professors. However, when I took Business  Statistics, I got a 
  great class and a great professor. Dr. Arsham really transforms Business  
  Statistics into the "Joy of  Statistics." Before taking this class, I was 
  oblivious to the important role that Business  Statistics  plays in the many 
  aspects of our daily living. I have been enlightened in a way that I never 
  thought was possible, and I will treasure the knowledge that I have gained 
  throughout my career and throughout my life. Thanks to Dr. Arsham, I am a 
  Management Scientist. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Professor Arsham definitely knows his stuff. However, this alone does not 
  a good teacher makes! Two other things made this course notable for me. First, 
  Professor Arsham has taken a fairly complex subject and taught it in a 
  meaningful and understandable way. Second, Professor Arsham has a passion for 
  helping a student along this learning process. He challenged us as students 
  but provided careful guidance along the way. Although not an expert, I have 
  the understanding that I need to be a more effective decision-maker in the 
  business world. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Having recently completed this class I'd like to pass along some feedback. 
  Overall I felt the course was very valuable. Understanding Business  
  Statistics  and the tools that can help bring better solutions to complex 
  decisions is a skill I will use in both my business and personal life. The 
  class draws upon many different learning techniques. Each week you have 
  readings from the text, professor Arsham's lecture notes, and many supporting 
  web sites. Problems from the text reinforce the concepts each week and the use 
  of computer package to solve problems allows hands on learning of the tool. 
  The class is structured so that each week you are reinforcing what was learned 
  in previous weeks as well as learning new concepts and tools. In addition to 
  my understanding of Business  Statistics  I have the knowledge of many web 
  sites, which I can continue to browse and use as a reference in the future. 
  <BR>Thanks Prof. Arsham for another valuable class. 
  <P>
  <P>The following is a part of a formal letter sent to the University 
  President:  
  <P></P>
  <LI>.....I would like to take this opportunity to express my praise for one 
  professor in particular. Dr. Hossein Arsham, is undoubtedly one of the 
  University of Baltimore's most valued assets. As a student in his class, 
  conducted entirely over the Web, I was not only impressed with his expert 
  knowledge on the subject matter, but also by his profound style of teaching. 
  There was never a time during the semester when Dr. Arsham allowed a student's 
  question to linger unanswered or concern to remain unnoticed. Dr. Arsham is 
  not only able to effectively communicate with his students, but is able to 
  reach them to the degree that they understand and appreciate the course and 
  the subject. This is a skill held only by academia's best, a group that 
  unquestionably includes Dr. Arsham.  University of Baltimore have introduced 
  me to professors I would consider not only the best in their respective 
  fields, but also in the art of teaching. Dr. Arsham is most definitely among 
  the top of this distinguished group.

  <LI>As an engineer pursuing my MBA, I found Dr. Arsham's course on Business 
  Statistics to be the most useful course I've taken to date at UB in Bridging 
  the gap between the technical world and that of the managerial.  Dr. Arsham is 
  able to bring numbers and statistics alive and give them meaning.  As An 
  instructor he is both disciplined and understanding of student needs.<BR> 
  While he is uncompromising in his method of teaching and rigorous in his 
  treatment of the material, he is also most forgiving as I grew as a student 
  under his tutelage.<BR> In past courses I have never had difficulties with 
  mathematics such as calculus or differential equations, but statistics and 
  probability courses have always vexed me.  For the first time in my life, Dr. 
  Arsham has enabled me to grasp the elusive meaning and mechanics of 
  statistical analysis. Indeed, I've even purchased and began reading one of the 
  books from his "recommended reading list" in order  to continue my growth in 
  this subject area.  At this point I can honestly say that a well-founded 
  knowledge of basic  statistics may be the most important class a business 
  student should consider taking.  I HIGHLY recommend his course to any serious 
  student who really wants to know how to analyze and understand statistics. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Business Economics and Forecasting is one of those courses that have 
  prepared me FAR beyond mere academics. Being able to make the right decisions 
  "within" our respective professions and "throughout" our personal life is the 
  key ingredient to success. From day one, Professor Arsham emphasized this - 
  through hands-on illustrations and open discussions. The relentless attempt by 
  Dr. Arsham to associate Business Economics and Forecasting to real life 
  decision-making helped me appreciate this course further more. In addition to 
  Professor Arsham's vast knowledge and expertise in the field of Business 
  Decision Making, the Web site hosted by Dr. Arsham, is a further blessing. 
  Students taking this course will consider Dr. Arsham's Web site a gold mine in 
  terms of its constructive format and instructive contents. I would encourage 
  students to rely heavily on the course textbook (especially the first three 
  chapters), which I found enormously accommodating and easy to absorb. The 
  external Web site reviews is another source of first-rate information. I 
  commend Dr. Arsham for including this in the course syllabus. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Applied Business Economics and Forecasting ECON650 course has been an 
  incredible course, with its implications reaching far out into the realm of 
  business decisions as well as day-to-day life decisions.  Dr. Arsham, in a 
  professional, very friendly manner, shows the student how to embark on the 
  journey to the joy of Business Economics and Forecasting, the road to better 
  decisions.  Dr. Arsham has called this course "success science", and after 
  completing this course I can definitely refer to this course as well by such a 
  name.  In life we "goal seek", and that is the name of the game in this 
  subject: we must maximize profits, and minimize costs subject to whichever 
  constraints and obstacles we may face.   
  <P>There is much to gain from this course, given the expert methodology from 
  the world of Business Economics and Forecasting and business as well as daily 
  life wisdom.  All of this is available from Dr. Arsham and his decades of 
  experience.  You <I>will</I> enjoy what you will learn, and you <I>will</I> 
  find this class to be extremely important for your careers. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>OPRE 504 is a well-rounded class with opportunities to learn from the Web 
  sites the lectures, book and lecture notes. The lectures were particularly 
  helpful as Dr. Arsham spoke a lot about the concepts that are important, why 
  they are important, and what they mean. Dr. Arsham also takes the time to 
  review the highlights throughout the course, as well.  It was helpful to have 
  this conceptual information to see how the pieces fit together. The course 
  information Web site was very useful- to check your homework, to use E-labs to 
  complete assignments, for reading about special topics, and to use practice 
  questions and practice exams.   The web site reviews were fun too, who knew 
  there was so much information available about statistics?  Some of them were 
  really fun with neat graphics. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I had a great opportunity learning about Business Statistics for 
  decision-making subject with this course. Before taking course I have little 
  knowledge about statistics which most of them I could not even remember. I 
  love studying with the numbers and the course was based on the numbers. That 
  is another subject I like about the course. The exams' style makes students 
  not to memorize, instead make them to understand and learn. In my personal 
  view understanding and learning are much better than memorizing. Because 
  memorizing is short-term whereas understanding is long term, to tell the truth 
  about the course web site although it is complicated it gives all the 
  information that I need. I did not even buy the book, but study lecture notes 
  and course notes on the web. So that it was very helpful for me. Also I 
  learned several useful web sites because of the links in the course web site. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Given the often-complex subject matter, which for those who are unable to 
  analyze and interpret statistical methods and concepts, Professor Arsham did 
  an admirable job of motivating me to succeed. He took the time to excite the 
  class into believing that business statistics, in its purest form, can be used 
  in most everyday activities. After taking this class with Professor Arsham, I 
  feel better prepared to utilize what he taught me in other classes in my 
  pursued of my MBA.  Thank you Professor Arsham. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>ECON650 course was both enjoyable and a valuable learning experience.  The 
  text, lectures, and assignments all contributed to my learning.  But I think 
  the most important things I learned during this course were from the 
  professor. Listening to the lectures helped me view decision-making and life 
  in general differently.  Professor Arsham taught me the importance of critical 
  thinking as well as important life philosophies.  Overall, this course was 
  very meaningful for my development both professionally and personally.  It is 
  important to keep up with the assignments and reading, but very worthwhile 
  too! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>As an engineer pursuing my MBA, I found Dr. Arsham's course on Business 
  Statistics to be the most useful course I've taken to date at UB in bridging 
  the gap between the technical world and that of the managerial.  Dr. Arsham is 
  able to bring numbers and statistics alive and give them meaning.  As an 
  instructor he is both disciplined and understanding of student needs.  While 
  he is uncompromising in his method of teaching and rigorous in his treatment

  taking.  I HIGHLY recommend his course to any serious student who really wants 
  to know how to analyze and understand statistics. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I believe the thinking process was the greatest aspect of this course.  
  You showed/taught us not to assume things and to think beyond what we had 
  previously learned.  An example of this is "any number divided by itself is 
  one".  There are other examples, but I won't list them here.  You are a very 
  passionate teacher who genuinely cares about the future of your students. You 
  always tried to give the credit to the students and lift up the spirits and 
  morale of the students.  Very few teachers express the level of understanding 
  and caring that you expressed during the class.  Thank you for an excellent 
  educational experience.  I will remember the  statistical thinking aspects of 
  this class in large part to your successful teaching style. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>As far as my experience in this class, well all I can say to future 
  students is to keep an open mind for this course. Professor Arsham expects you 
  to do well and lays the foundation for you to do so but you must pay 
  attention. Look at the big picture, as it will help you figure out the little 
  details. I was very intimidated when this class started but left with much 
  confidence in my ability to make better decisions. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Saturday classes are not something to look forward to, in general.  
  However, Professor Arsham's enthusiasm for the subject and respect for his 
  students made the four-hour class go by quickly and I left with a feeling of 
  accomplishment as his thorough explanations sunk in.  The textbook was more 
  helpful and complementary for the second half of the course (the probabilistic 
  models) as the material seemed more straightforward but this is probably 
  debatable.  Exams are fair and Dr. Arsham makes every effort to help students 
  succeed in this relevant and practical subject.  My advice: go to class, do 
  your assignments show an interest and success will be attainable. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham's course is the most thought provoking, enjoyable and valuable 
  that I've experienced in the MBA program at UB. As espoused by an engaging 
  professor whose enthusiasm for teaching and his students is palpable, the 
  principles of Business Economics and Forecasting are applicable to nearly any 
  discipline.  One would be well advised to look for opportunities for 
  practicing them as a means of making better decisions on the job or in 
  personal matters. Free of the need to memorize formulae and the protocol for 
  applying them, one learns not only the fundamentals of Business Economics and 
  Forecasting but also how to learn more in this important emerging field.  
  Assignments are time-consuming but not especially difficult.  Timely  
  completion will help to prepare one for exams, which are fair and as such 
  favor those students who regularly attend lecture.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>I just wanted to thank you, on a few levels.  Firstly, I really enjoy your 
  lectures, mainly because I (as well as most any student you ever taught) can 
  see, how much you love transferring knowledge to you students and important 
  the knowledge that has is to you.  Whether you are clearly explaining another 
  concept of Business Economics and Forecasting so that all minds can grasp, or 
  instilling in us a philosophy that you believe whole heatedly will improve the 
  quality of our lives or at least of our thinking.  I would also like to thank 
  you for all you efforts in going over all the homework we hand in, I know this 
  a huge endeavor as you leave every session with a six-or more-inch-thick pile 
  of homework.  As it is understood that the job of the student is to do 
  homework for their own education and it is the job of the teacher/professor to 
  grade and analyze their homework. I must say that you spend more time on every 
  detail of our work than most professors do.  On that note I want to thank you 
  for your kinds words of encouragement at the end of a set of work, where you 
  not only praise the efforts, but you actually make me (the student) feel that 
  you are sincerely proud of the efforts put in.  Thank you again, and I must 
  say that I feel very fortunate to be in your class this semester. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>When I first started this class, I wasn't sure what to expect.  After I 
  browsed through the first couple of chapters in the text, it lead me to 
  believe that this was going to be another typical course full of formulas and 
  diagrams to memorize - but I was wrong.  While it is true that there are 
  formulas and theories to learn, I found it much easier to learn from Dr. 
  Arsham's lectures and his website for this course.  Although the text
   presented the same ideas, the lectures were far more interesting, and the 
  website showed how to solve the problems more systematically, and provided 
  more of a "how-to" method, versus the text serving mainly as an overview of 
  the topics.  Because the lectures were designed around real-world 
  applications, it was much easier to see how the subject matter was applicable 
  to all areas of life, not just business. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham uses a very engaging style of lecture that aids in making the 
  concepts applicable in real life situations.  The textbook was an effective 
  supplement, as it answered most of what I did not initially understand in 
  class.  Testing methods are very fair and very effective, as they prove to be 
  a valid measure of how much one has truly learned.  If you'll open your mind 
  to the approaches suggested in this class, they will change the way you look 
  at everything.  "When there is a way, there is a will".   
  <P></P>
  <LI>Reading materials are challenging, and exciting. Class sessions are never 
  boring. While doing my weekly Web site reviews, I noticed that other 
  university all over the world is using our course Web sites. Professionally, 
  as an aspiring Management Scientist, this is a reassurance that the University 
  of Baltimore MBA program is of international caliber and offers the student a 
  broad range of classes and programs including a top notch Business Economics 
  and Forecasting program. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham assigns many homework assignments, but they really do assist 
  the learning process.  I really learned a lot of valuable information from the 
  website reviews.  Dr. Arsham is very enthusiastic and enjoyable in the class.  
  He returns e-mails his students send to him with/questions very timely.  His 
  web board is very helpful allowing his students to communicate with each 
  other. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham's website was more valuable than the textbook.  Dr. Arsham is 
  very knowledgeable and he makes the subject matter and class very interesting. 
   He is thought provoking and practical.  I enjoyed his style of teaching. I do 
  not think the website review were very valuable other than for informational 
  purposes. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Reading material from the textbook use current and familiar examples 
  relevant to business students, answers to some problems were helpful.  Use of 
  designs and tables was good.  Need to be proofread more carefully. Assignments 
  were clear and relevant; allowed you to get through understanding of subject 
  matter.  Use of website was good.   Dr. Arsham lectures are   conversational 
  in tone, which was enjoyable, and provides good use of examples. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Applied Business Economics and Forecasting is an interesting course that 
  relates to all disciplines and all aspects of life.  The key is to be able to 
  quantify whatever data or information you have and use mathematics (or 
  technology) to help in decision-making.  To prepare for the course, review 
  basic algebra and statistics.  Follow Dr. Arsham's suggestion to read the 
  introduction to each chapter as these will help to broaden your thinking on 
  what Business Economics and Forecasting is.  The websites he assigns for 
  reading will also enlighten you, especially when you realize how passionate 
  people are about the subject. I suggest getting familiar with QSB right from 
  the start and using it to check your answers and to do many "what-ifs"; this 
  will increase your understanding tremendously. Overall, have fun with AMS, and 
  try to apply it to everyday situations.  It works!   
  <P></P>
  <LI>Reading materials was in accordance to course lecture.  I understood all 
  the topics covered  because of good teaching.  Professor  Arsham was helpful, 
  and insightful.  I want to thank him for his disposition towards his students. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The text was, for the most part, clear and easy to follow.  Dr. Arsham 
  explained class topics in a good manner and used good examples that were easy 
  to understand he is also very enjoyable.  Assignments pertained to class work. 
  The subject matter of this course is very interesting.  Assignments are 
  helpful in grouping subject matter. Dr. Arsham was available at all times to 
  help. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I thank you again for a wonderful semester.  I learned a lot.  I've also 
  learned how to learn and  I have a lot to learn!  As Dr. Arsham once said "In 
  the world of the future, the new illiterate will be the person who has not 
  learned how to learn." 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Let me take this opportunity to thank you for all the effort that you put 
  on me in two of the courses that I took with you (Business Statistics and 
  Applied Business Economics and Forecasting). And I must say that those two 
  were the most interesting classes I have taken at UB. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>..to make better decisions as future managers, you need to take the 
  applied Business Economics and Forecasting course.  Dr. Arsham would break 
  this course topics down for you smoothly. At the end of the class, trust me 
  you will not regret your decision of coming to his class. Neither will you 
  forget your professor's sense of humor. Dr. Arsham, once again, thanks you 
  very much and I hope to have you as a  mentor again. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I must say I had a great time.  This was the best class I have had thus 
  far at UB.  I really  enjoyed your class.  Preparation for your tests is very 
  important and just preparing your own Summary-Sheets helps  to reinforce the 
  concepts in your mind.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>I really enjoyed your passion for teaching.  I have to admit in other 
  classes that I may have taken in the past,  an 8:15PM course is usually long 
  and tiring.  Your class was always fresh and filled with energy.  It felt like 
  my day did not start until 8:15PM since that was the highlight of the day.   
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham is a great instructor. He made the class very interesting!  The 
  homework assignments are very helpful in learning.  The instructor is 
  excellent—very good at helping people understand. Also very available. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>It was a pleasure having Professor Arsham as an instructor for the past 
  two semesters.  I have learned much about business statistics and decision 
  making, which I am putting to good use on the job and in my personal life.  
  You have been the best, and most influential professor I have had to this 
  point in the UB MBA program.  Thank you for your genuine love of the subject, 
  which is infectious to your students, and for your equally genuine desire to 
  see your students succeed.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>The textbook is sometimes hard to understand.  QSB package is very 
  interesting and friendly.  Professor Arsham is very stimulating and fun to be 
  with.  Assignments were useful, valuable cause he (the instructor) made sure 
  we learned.  He is great. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I really respect Prof. Arsham's knowledge and his willingness to share 
  that knowledge.   Reading’s materials from the textbook are good use of 
  examples.  Many areas and problems are incorrect because it is a new edition.  
  The homework assignments are challenging— I was glad that solutions made 
  available on the web board for reference.  Instructor is very interesting.  He 
  made me think. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I found the course also to be one of the very best I have taken.  Not only 
  was the information was well presented, it is applicable to many facets of my 
  current position; I suppose that is what made my success in this course.  The 
  course work and tests were not too difficult nor were they giveaways. The real 
  final for this course will be how well I am able to apply the concepts 
  presented to my career and everyday life. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Beside good technical lectures, Dr. Arsham is enjoyable with all of the 
  interesting his sayings that he uses in class.   During the class, I would 
  often write down some of the things he has said that I considered to be very 
  wise.  My favorite was: "Understanding is the joy in life.  When you don't 
  understand, you simply end up hating it." <BR>Dr. Arsham also had a share of 
  funny comments, such as: " The product of a chicken is an egg.  The product of 
  man is thought.   Do not scramble these two, my friend."    Dr. Arsham, please 
  continue using them in your classes.  They have the effect of making class 
  very thoughtful and relaxing.  Thank you for a great class. Here is paragraph 
  describing my thoughts on the course: 
  <P>  Applied Business Economics and Forecasting requires more effort than most 
  of the ECON650 graduate courses that the University of Baltimore offers.  The 
  main goal of the class is to teach students how to think.  The  class uses a 
  variety of methods to accomplish this including homework, web board 
  discussions, class participation, and research on a focused area or 
  application of Business Economics and Forecasting.  This course does not allow 
  you to simply come to class, take notes, and cram for an exam.  In fact, 
  students should make an effort to avoid this type of mentality.  Applied 
  Business Economics and Forecasting does provide your money's worth.  If you 
  consistently apply yourself to the material discussed in the class, you will 
  leave it as a more enlightened person. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I just wanted to say that Dr. Arsham is an inspiration for me in the field 
  of education. He is everything that I always thought a teacher should be.  I 
  will use the methods I learned for the rest of my life I believe.  Thanks for 
  a great semester. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham is very attentive to students' learning the material.  He is 
  very dedicated and caring; willing to work one on one.   He is a true asset to 
  U.B. The homework assignments are very helpful, they are mostly real-world 
  applications; website was extremely useful and clear.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>My assessment of Business Economics and Forecasting ECON650 with Dr. 
  Arsham is that the class provides a good, well-balanced understanding of 
  decision-making skills through an integrated approach.  Class lecture and 
  discussion, excellent Web site resources, including Dr. Arsham's Web site 
  containing class notes and in-depth discussions on OR/MS/DS topics, combined 
  with learning to use QSB software to solve linear programming and decision 
  problems, all contributed to the learning experience.  Doing the homework for 
  the class is critical to learning and understanding the concepts, so don't 
  neglect that.  Also, I recommend that you use the Internet resources, to which 
  Dr. Arsham directs you, to help you better understand any of the topics that 
  you're having any difficulty grasping - there's a wealth of knowledge and help 
  available.  Recognizing the relevance of the subject matter, and the powerful 
  decision-making tools it provided for me to use not only on the job, but in 
  everyday life, combined with Dr. Arsham's pragmatic and fun approach to 
  learning, I found this class to be one of my favorites! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Applied Business Economics and Forecasting (ECON650) Course is probably 
  the most  beneficial course that someone could take other than the courses in 
  the  field under which he or she is majoring. As a finance major, I found this 
   course highly beneficial. This course, overall, is about decision making.  
  <P>Life itself is all about decision-making, isn't it? In this course, one  
  learns how to make good decisions. The contents of this course i.e., linear  
  programming, transportation problems, networking, decision tree, and so on 
  are, in fact, giving us an idea about how to make good decisions in other 
  fields. We can use those models in our new challenges. More importantly, one 
  learns that no matter how complex the problem is, the methodology to be 
  followed remains to be same in most cases. While talking about the course, I 
  would like to point out that the students who will take the ECON650 course at 
  the University of Baltimore are so lucky to have an instructor like Dr. 
  Arsham. He supports his excellency in teaching with his life experiences, 
  which contributes to our knowledge and experience a lot. I never forget this 
  sentence 'think before you act, many people do vice versa', which was said by 
  Dr. Arsham in one of our class sessions.  Dr. Arsham also encourages students 
  to exchange ideas both in class and on the web. He has a superb web site in 
  which one can find all of his lecture notes, past exams, and links to other 
  sites about Business Decision Making and Business Economics and Forecasting. 
  Dr. Arsham periodically wanted us to review those web sites and write our 
  comments about them. Students also have the flexibility to choose any topic 
  that they are interested in (as long as it is related to Business Economics 
  and Forecasting) when they write their term paper. 
  <P>Summing up, I definitely recommend the new students to take this course and 
  guarantee that they'll learn a lot while enjoying. As Dr. Arsham calls it "THE 
  JOY OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND FORECASTING"! Good luck to you all!" 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dear future students,<BR>This class will indeed change the way you think.  
  Your professor is amazing and you are very lucky to have him.  You will learn 
  about both Business Economics and Forecasting and life from him. Some simple 
  tips:<BR>1.  Attend class (the subject matter is a little difficult but if you 
  attend class it is much easier to learn than if you try to teach it to 
  yourself).<BR>2.  Read to lecture notes on the web! This will explain 
  everything you will  need to know.  Reading the book was not necessary but 
  attending class and reading the lecture notes are key.<BR>3.  KEEP UP WITH 
  ASSIGNMENTS!!  Many of my classmates fell behind in their homework.  I found 
  that by getting my homework done on time and turning it in made this class 
  much easier as I did not have to do a semester's worth of homework in one 
  week. Besides, it really does help in the understanding of the subject matter. 
   Dr. Arsham does not assign these problems just to give you busy work. They 
  really do help you learn.<BR>4.  Most importantly, DON'T BE INTIMIDATED BY THE 
  SUBJECT MATTER. Dr. Arsham  is one of the best teachers and if you pay 
  attention and keep up it will be relatively easy and painless.  Just think of 
  all of us who went before you.  <BR>We are no smarter than you.  You can do it 
  and you will enjoy this class. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Business Economics and Forecasting and Dr. Arsham, one could not have 
  asked for a better combination.  As a student, I really appreciate when I take 
  good classes that have good professors.  However, when I took Applied Business 
  Economics and Forecasting, I got a great class and a great professor.  Dr. 
  Arsham really transforms Applied Business Economics and Forecasting into the 
  "Joy of Business Economics and Forecasting."  Before taking this class, I was 
  oblivious to the important role that Business Economics and Forecasting plays 
  in the many aspects of our daily living.  I have been enlightened in a way 
  that I never thought was possible, and I will treasure the knowledge that I 
  have gained throughout my career and throughout my life.  Thanks to Dr. 
  Arsham, I am a Management Scientist. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Not having had a strong educational background in mathematics coupled with 
  my awareness that I had been out of school (undergraduate) for over 10 years 
  now, upon starting this course I felt somewhat intimidated. I wondered if it 
  would be too difficult for me; or if I would be completely lost in trying to 
  grasp the concepts. Having said that, I will advise you now to take everything 
  one step at a time, do your readings and pay attention, and you will do just 
  fine.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham has to be one of the most knowledgeable professors in his 
  subject matter. Lucky you because he has put a tremendous amount of care and 
  effort in ensuring your success in this course by providing you with all the 
  resources and references you need to help you learn. Yes the subject matter is 
  probably more thought provoking than your other courses thus far, but that's 
  O.K. Read his Web site. It contains a wealth of thorough information that will 
  help you more clearly grasp the concepts. You will probably read some of the 
  referenced readings and ask, why am I reading this? Read them anyway and 
  you'll see that, by the end of the course, everything ties together. The key 
  is overall understanding and then learning how to apply your new knowledge 
  into your assignments and also into your life.  
  <P>The textbook is well written, and helpful. I recommend reading the chapters 
  once for a general overview and then reading them again for further, clearer 
  understanding. The assignments can be time consuming, but once complete, there 
  is an added gratification in knowing you've mastered something new and 
  challenging. As for the lectures with Dr. Arsham, you will enjoy every single 
  one. You will definitely learn a lot in the course that will give you added 
  insight and value.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>Applied Business Economics and Forecasting requires discipline, time and 
  energy to fully realize the benefits of the theory in which can be applied to 
  both the work and "real" world. Completion of homework assignments is 
  essential to the understanding of the discipline and for the successful 
  outcome with the exams. Rewards reaped from the class will vary and will 
  depend on the amount of effort put forth. Good luck and enjoy the infectious 
  enthusiasm exhibited by Professor Arsham! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Do not get behind on the homework, and be sure to read Dr. Arsham's web 
  site, which corresponds to the lecture notes.  If fact, try to get a good jump 
  and stay ahead on the homework as much as possible.  Don't worry about taking 
  many notes in class, just focus on what Dr. Arsham is saying...(be a thinker)! 
   Relax, and enjoy the class.  You will find him exceptionally fair, 
  straightforward, and logical.  If you are in  need for some motivation, you 
  will find it in his class lectures. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>This is the most important course you will take in your MBA program.  Why? 
   Because the principles of Business Economics and Forecasting apply to all 
  disciplines.  Marketing, finance, organizational development, strategic 
  planning, and production - ALL areas require the science of making defendable, 
  rational decisions.  Moreover, these initial decisions are always subject to 
  constant review and change -based upon the changing  environment.  In other 
  words, the decision making process is dynamic. <BR>In order to successfully 
  utilize the tools of decision-making - one MUST develop and start down the 
  road of mastering the art of critical thinking.  This course taught me to 
  think and look at problems and situations from a new perspective.  Already, in 
  my professional career, these principles have been applied and have given  me 
  new and interesting approaches to professional challenges.  <BR>I would 
  suggest that you do the work and review the web site - it is outstanding. The 
  more professional experience that one has will bring more value and 
  appreciation for the principles and tools discussed and taught in this course. 
   My final thought would be to say that this course is one that will definitely 
  continue when you walk out the door at the end of the semester. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Applied Business Economics and Forecasting turned out to be a lot more 
  than I expected.   This was a wonderful course.  We learned the concepts 
  involved in making  good decisions.  Then, we used the WinQSB software to 
  apply those concepts  and see first hand how effective the applications of 
  those concepts could be.    The lectures along with the homework assignments 
  blended very well to give  a complete understanding of Business Economics and 
  Forecasting.  I know that I will now be  able  to make better decisions, and I 
  am pretty sure that whoever completes  this course will too.  Good Luck, and 
  Have Fun!! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The personal warmth and wisdom of Professional Arsham should not provide 
  you, the student with the feeling of another "cake course".  The good feel of 
  class must be left in class as you do the hard work at home.  Count on at 
  least six hours per week of computer time to handle the required homework and 
  study…this is a conservative estimate.  Take some advice from someone who 
  thought they knew better, and approached the course like he had all 
  others…come to class, juggle time constraints, and delay homework to the last 
  minute.  If this is your approach, change it.  Do the homework in a timely 
  fashion, and, to get the most out of the course, come to class with specific 
  questions.  Only then will you get the thorough understanding you'll need to 
  "Ace" the course.  (By the way, I was not an "A" student for this course.)  
  The exams are fair, but not easy.  How you do in this course is totally your 
  decision.  By the end of it, you'll be more than capable of making that 
  decision.  If you heed the advice, you'll have no regrets looking back. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I think this class is a beneficial part of the MBA curriculum.  I thought 
  the introduction was crucial, as many students entering UB's program have not 
  had a math course in years, have never taken a statistics course, and most 
  have never heard of Business Decision Making or Business Economics and 
  Forecasting.  The structure of the course and the website were indispensable 
  to the learning process.  The course's structure integrated the WWW, industry 
  software, an academic book, and lecture material.  Dr. Arsham's website tied 
  together all of these tools and gave the student a framework of reference.  
  Most importantly, I thought it was most crucial that we learned how to 
  understand the software's output and the vocabulary of Business Economics and 
  Forecasting because these are what we will need next year when we become part 
  of the professional world.  Too many academic institutions seem to loose sight 
  of this important issue, and instead shelter students inside a textbook world, 
  which often leaves them unprepared to handle real world challenges.  Professor 
  Arsham's style as a teacher is rather unique and effective. Overall, I feel I 
  benefited and would recommend it to other students. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I truly enjoyed the class Applied Business Economics and Forecasting.  I 
  found the subject matter stimulating and Dr. Arsham's lectures very 
  interesting.  One of the best pieces of advice I could give to future students 
  is to keep up with the homework and reading.  There is a lot of homework in 
  this class, all designed to aid in the understanding of the subject matter, 
  and if you fall behind it is not only hard to keep up, but you also do not 
  gain any knowledge from the lectures. <BR>Dr. Arsham is a credit to his 
  profession.  He takes the time to help all of his students and has put a lot 
  of time in developing the course materials.  Most important he loves to share 
  the knowledge he has gained with others.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>Now that the class is over, I just wanted to let you know how much I 
  enjoyed this class.  To be completely honest, at the beginning of the 
  semester, I was not looking forward to applied mgmt. sciences.  I didn't 
  exactly know what to expect and what it was all about.  I can now honestly say 
  that this class has opened my eyes when it comes to decision-making.  I look 
  at all my decisions knowing that there could be more than one answer and that 
  some decisions need more thinking before they are made.  I am currently in the 
  law school also and I plan on applying what I have learned from this class to 
  my law studies.  I apologize for not going into this class with a positive 
  attitude.  Now I understand why former students of Dr. Arsham said that this 
  was one of the best classes they ever had.  This wasn't about memorizing 
  facts.  This was about really using your mind and seeing a whole new picture 
  and I thank Professor Arsham very much for that. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I really enjoyed this class.  The structure of the class was excellent.  I 
  found it very helpful having everything we went over in class on the Web as 
  well.  This way I didn't have to take notes during Lecture, which enabled me 
  to pay better attention to what we were being taught and comprehend the 
  concepts.  The assignments were very important to my success in the class 
  because I was able to take what we went over and apply it to the homework.  
  Dr. Arsham was an excellent teacher.  I really enjoyed his teaching style.  He 
  made it fun to wake up and come to class at 8:30 Saturday morning.  I would 
  gladly take another class taught by Dr. Arsham.  Once again, thank you Dr. 
  Arsham for an enjoyable semester.   
  <P></P>
  <LI>This Applied Business Economics and Forecasting class assists its students 
  by providing techniques for formulating problems and deriving solutions. It is 
  defined as the science of decision-making.  It requires an understanding of 
  mathematical principles.  The classes are essentially lectures, where Dr. 
  Arsham presents the material.  I refer to the class sessions as strictly 
  lectures because note taking is not required. Dr. Arsham has compiled notes 
  for you on his web site, which is very comprehensive. He often teaches from 
  these notes. The concepts presented are valuable.  The home assignments should 
  be completed as they are assigned to assist you in understanding the concepts 
  better.  The home assignment portion of his web site should be checked often 
  as he changes it as required.  The web site reviews are not valuable in 
  understanding the material, however they provide insight into the diversity of 
  the subject matter.  The textbook and associated QSB software is very 
  comprehensive as well.  The text does not include step-by-step instructions 
  for using the software but Dr. Arsham covers everything in class and his web 
  notes are available for reinforcement.  The tests mimic the home assignments. 
  I enjoyed this course because I see direct implementation of the subject 
  matter in my everyday life.  I also enjoyed Dr. Arsham for his displayed 
  commitment to delivering the material effectively, his compassion , and his 
  insight.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>THINK.  That is the most concise and descriptive word that I can imagine 
  to describe how to approach this course.  As with all "grad" students, I felt 
  that I was a pretty decent thinker myself, until I encountered this course. 
  Dr. Arsham assisted us in thinking about things in a whole new light.  Many 
  times he described seeing things with new eyes and thinking about beautiful 
  things.  I was really confused as to what it was this professor expected to do 
  with us during the semester.  Slowly, I understood that sometimes we have to
   Think outside the "box" to make the best and most informed decisions. A major 
  lesson that I learned was how to back up and support management decisions with 
  factual evidence.  Anyone can make a decision, but a good manager makes 
  decisions based on supported facts.  This can mean the difference between 
  unemployment and a b-line up the corporate ladder. It's much easier to defend 
  a bad decision if it is based on hard facts.  Overall, have a good time in 
  class and above all... DO YOUR HOMEWORK WEEKLY.  The homework is designed to 
  help you in the class and trust me; you don't want to be doing it at the last 
  moment. Take care and enjoy class so that you too can "think about beautiful 
  things, that is, the joyful knowledge." 
  <P></P>
  <LI>My experience in ECON650 was definitely a worthwhile one.  The course 
  covered a narrow breadth of material while going into great depth on the 
  issues covered, assuring if you did the work, you definitely would understand 
  the topic.  Heavy work on the same problems led to a quick familiarity with 
  them and made applying new methods to them easier to understand.  Dr. Arsham 
  gives students every chance to excel and achieve the highest grades that they 
  can.  Understanding of the topics is his main goal, and students who work hard 
  on the assignments will undoubtedly do well in his class.  The lessons learned 
  in the class can be easily applied to many business decision students will be 
  faced with and the integration of computer tools from class will aid in these 
  situations. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I would like to say that I found in Dr. Arsham's subject a very 
  interesting perspective and very dynamic. I was completely influenced. The 
  things I learn during the course are important and useful, not only at work, 
  also in private life decisions.  I also thought that publishing his material 
  on a Web site is a very fast and comfortable way to distribute it, and a very 
  easy way to get it for the students. It also allows other people to learn 
  about making decisions and I think that is very convenient.  
  <P></P>
  <LI>I would like to thank Dr. Arsham for a wonderful class.  The most 
  important thing I learned from him  was the value of "thinking".  Many people 
  take "thinking" for granted by not taking the time to  evaluate all options 
  and possible solutions to the problems encountered. I feel as though ECON650 
  has given me a foundation to use in almost every decision I have had to make 
  since the  first day of class.   Thank you Dr. Arsham! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>..I found Dr. Arsham's lecture a very interesting perspective and very 
  stimulating. The things I learn during the course are important and useful, 
  not only at work, also in our daily life decisions. Publishing his material on 
  his Web site assists us to learn about making decisions and I think that is 
  very essential. The most important thing I learned from this lecture was 
  "thinking". Dr. Arsham allowed us in thinking about things in a new 
  perspective. Second, I learned that the course can be easily applied to 
  numerous business decision as well as real life. Lastly I figured out, one can 
  make a decision, but an educated one makes decisions based on supported facts. 
  I hereby would like to thank Dr. Arsham for thoughtful semester. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham's ECON650 class is by far the best class I've been in for my 
  MBA program at UB.  While the course has challenging and complex material, Dr. 
  Arsham presents it in a manner to help facilitate our learning experience.  
  Dr. Arsham not only uses theoretical models to illustrate the topics covered 
  in this course, but he also provides useful real-life applications.  I found 
  his assignments and examinations to be challenging but very fair.  I would 
  highly recommend his course. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>On the first day of ECON650, I felt overwhelmed by the mere subject of 
  Applied Business Economics and Forecasting.  However, by the second class, Dr. 
  Arsham enlightened the class with different aspects of decision-making and how 
  this process not only affects the business environment, but also our personal 
  lives.  This class sharpens management and decision-making skills by 
  presenting interesting case studies and mathematical concepts that can be 
  applied to real life situations.  I would highly recommend Dr. Arsham's course 
  to all MBA students! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Applied Business Economics and Forecasting is a course of learning.  It 
  teaches you how to learn and how to think about what you learn.  Dr. Arsham 
  gives you many perspectives on how to make good informed decisions even when 
  complete information is not available.  The course is based on mathematical 
  models used in a decision making process, but is not mathematics at all.  It 
  is about interpretation of the model's results and the communication of those 
  results.  Communication of the results in a comprehensive matter allows 
  management personnel to make better business decisions.  The theories behind 
  these models are also applicable to our personal lives as well.  It assists us 
  in making decisions about investments, traveling, medical procedures, starting 
  a business, etc.  I found the course to be one of the most useful and 
  informative classes in University of Baltimore's MBA program.  Work hard and 
  look beyond just the textbook and what you read.  Look inside of yourself as 
  well to see how these models can apply to your life.  This will help you to 
  understand the concepts.  The light bulb will go off, I promise. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dear ECON650 Student: <BR>Dr. Arsham will be the most thought-provoking 
  teacher that you will have at UB. His lectures are filled with concepts and 
  ideas that will challenge you to think outside your realm of consciousness. 
  <BR>The assignments will keep you challenged throughout the course. As long as 
  you keep up on your work, pay attention and participate during class, I 
  guarantee you will earn a good grade in this course. <BR>Dr. Arsham's relaxed 
  approach may lull you into thinking that you need not work hard in this 
  course. Don't fall into this trap. The subject matter is very practical and 
  easy to learn, but you must make a Graduate School effort. Don't treat this 
  class as an undergraduate course. If you let yourself fall behind, catching up 
  will be difficult. <BR>The subject matter is presented as a broad overview of 
  several topics within Business Economics and Forecasting. Do yourself a favor 
  and take your education to the next  level by exploring one or more of these 
  topics in-depth. Dr. Arsham presents external websites review on a weekly 
  basis that does in fact explore topics further than needed to pass the class. 
  These websites are your opportunity to get more out the course than is 
  required to pass. <BR>Good luck and enjoy learning from a teacher that you 
  will wish he taught/teaches all of your courses! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>This class forces one to think before acting.  It's a good practical class 
  and everybody should at some point in life learn the material taught in this 
  class.  Professor Arsham was definitely fair as far as grading goes.  His 
  focus is in helping the students learn.  One word of advice is that you print 
  the course material from the web page and then use it to take notes in class.  
  Keep up with the homework assignments and you'll do fine.  Have a great summer 
  Prof. Arsham. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>This is the first course I've taken at UB where I could immediately apply 
  the information presented not only to my work, but also to my personal life.  
  I found the content relevant and stimulating, but not overwhelming.  It is 
  refreshing to know that tough decisions can be simplified though proper 
  understanding and computer applications. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>I have been in UB’s MBA program for a year now and this class was the one 
  that I have enjoyed  the most thus far.  Professor Arsham is a wonderful 
  instructor and very understanding when it  comes a student juggling school, 
  work, and family.  The lectures are structured and very helpful  in 
  understanding the course.  With the web reviews being a part of your final 
  grade, they make  you actually take a look at the sites and more often than 
  not you can brush up on information that  you may have forgotten.  The CD that 
  comes with the textbook is a great way to be able to check  your homework 
  prior to turning it in and allows the student to see how a minute change can 
   affect the outcome of a problem.  Now I have a wider scope in understanding 
  the decision  making process. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The very first thing that I noticed about Professor Arsham was his zest 
  for life.  It literally drips off of him- it is contagious!  Clearly, I 
  thought, this is a man who truly understands himself and his world- or his 
  place in the world, and, through his generosity, helps others to understand 
  their place in the world.  <BR>     Upon my entrance to this course of study, 
  Applied Business Economics and Forecasting, as a graduate student, to be 
  honest, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I mean, really, I've made 
  literally thousands of decisions in the past and, for the most part, think 
  them to be good ones.  But it was not until I studied under Professor Arsham 
  that I truly understood how to make decisions - decisions based on scientific 
  reasoning.<BR>Responsive, respectful and engaging, Professor Arsham possesses 
  the perfect mixture of sensitivity and intellect to inspire students to 
  achieve.  The structure and pace of his course allowed students to both learn 
  and enjoy the study of decision science.  His enthusiasm for his chosen field 
  is surpassed only by his sincere compassion for the welfare of his students.  
  I speak for all of the students that have studied under Professor Arsham - we 
  appreciate everything that you have given us!!<BR>     In closing, I would 
  just like to say that there is no greater honor than have graduated as a 
  student of Professor Arsham's, to being a colleague of his.  He is my friend 
  and my advisor. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Without a doubt, one of the best professors you will ever have at 
  University of Baltimore.  Instead of asking you to memorize formulas and 
  chapters in the text, you will actually LEARN the material and how to apply it 
  to real-world situations.  Assignments are very helpful in understanding 
  lecture.  Dr. Arsham has well through knowledge of material.  He is also very 
  helpful,  fair, and a true professional.  Three pieces of advice:  keep up 
  with the homework, utilize the web-board, and enjoy the course!!! 
  <P></P>
  <LI>This course covers a lot of valuable material and is really just an entry 
  way into a very large field of study known as Business Economics and 
  Forecasting.  This is a very challenging introductory course, which gives an 
  excellent foundation for pursuing this subject in the future.  Between the 
  lectures, the web and the textbook there is a lot of information to absorb -- 
  the more time you devote to it, the more you will learn. However, you 
  shouldn't expect to master the topic, just acquire the necessary vocabulary 
  and building blocks to really pursue it if you wish.  Professor Arsham is very 
  enthusiastic about the subject and has a very positive view of the 
  student/individual.  He advocates that everyone should play an active role in 
  his or her learning and the decisions they make in life.  The first half of 
  the course deals with deterministic problems/decisions that don't involve a 
  lot of uncertainty, while the second half deals with more common complex 
  problems/decisions that have a lot of uncertainty.  I particularly liked the 
  decision analysis section of the course dealing with payoff matrices and 
  decision trees because these are such powerful tools to deal with complex 
  problems that we all face in private and public life.  I believe that learning 
  this material well, will be a real asset to any individual and enable anyone 
  to better manage his or her private and public lives.  What's great is that 
  Professor Arsham generously communicates this information and invites you to 
  be a part of this interesting and practical way of viewing decisions.  Now 
  that the course is complete, I really feel that I have learned a very valuable 
  set of tools, and am enthusiastic to learn more about the topic because it is 
  so useful.  From a very practical sense, it is important to have a fundamental 
  grasp of algebra and graphing, and it also helps to enjoy problem solving.  I 
  liked this course very much. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Dr. Arsham's class is probably the one of the most interesting classes 
  that you will take at the University of Baltimore.  The class is very well 
  organized and to some degree thanks to Dr. Arsham is web based, in that most 
  of the information you need is right there on Dr. Arsham's web site.  In 
  addition, throughout the class, you will find that the one thing that Dr. 
  Arsham does do is make sure you do is learn and understand the "Art" of making 
  good decisions.  You will find out that his class is not only applicable to 
  the business environment but what you learn in his class is applicable 
  throughout life.  After taking Dr. Arsham's class, you will look at 
  problems/decision making in a new manor that you never had before and the one 
  thing that you should truly learn is to "think".  Thanks for an excellent 
  semester.
